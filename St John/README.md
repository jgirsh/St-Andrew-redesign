I'll visit the website to see its design and structure, then create a clone for you.

Perfect! I can see this is St. John Catholic School's website. It's a beautiful design with a deep purple color scheme (#331555), gold accents, and a professional layout.

Design Analysis:
Key Sections:

Header - Purple navigation with gold eagle logo and dropdown menus
Hero - Large church entrance image with "WELCOMING" text and CTA buttons
Mission Statement - "SERVING GRADES PREK-8"
Three "We Believe" Sections - alternating text/image layouts
Application CTA - "ACCEPTING NEW FAMILY APPLICATIONS"
Statistics Section - Purple background with school stats
Latest News - Card grid
Social Media Feed
Upcoming Events - Calendar widget
Footer - School and parish information
This is a long, multi-section page. Would you like me to:

Clone the entire homepage (all sections)?
Clone specific sections (let me know which ones)?
Create a simplified version with the key sections?
Please let me know your preference, and I'll proceed with creating the website clone!

Excellent! The website structure is in place with the purple color scheme and all sections visible. However, I notice a few things that need refinement:

The hero image isn't loading properly
The header's diagonal accent needs adjustment
Some spacing improvements needed
